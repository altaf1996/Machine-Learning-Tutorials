    "- Machine Learning is the science (and art) of programming computers so they     can learn from data.\n",
    "- A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some     task T and some performance measure P, if its performance on T, as measured     by P, improves with experience E.\n",

    "# Why Use Machine Learning ?\n",
    "- In normal Programming language we will write a program using traditional approach.\n",
    "- 1) For Example First we will look how spam email looks like based on that we will write a set of rules. We noticed that some words or phrase such as (\"credit card\", \"amazing\", \"Free\", \"Discount\", \"4U\") tend to come up a lot in the subject and we also notice few other patterns in the senders name, the emails body and so on...\n",
    "- 2)Then we will write a detection algorithm for each of these pattern and our program would flag a email as spam or not-spam if a number of these pattern detected.\n",
    "- 3) You would test your program, and repeat step 2 and step 3 until it is good enough.\n",
    "- Then we lauch it to production after some time the Spammers notice that all their emails containing (\"credit card\", \"amazing\", \"Free\", \"Discount\", \"4U\") are blocked they may start writing \"4U\" as \"For you\" or as \"For U\" ,\"Free\" as \"No Money\" then again we have to write a set of rules for these changes and so on Forever.\n",
    "- By Using Traditional approach our program will become a long list of rules and pretty hard to maintain.\n",
    "- In contrast, a spam filter based on Machine Learning techniques automatically notices that \"For U\" has become unusually frequent in spam flagged by users, and it starts flagging them without your intervention.\n",
    "- Another Area where Machine Learning shines is for problems that either are too complex for traditional approaches or have no known algorithm. For example speech recognition.\n"

    "# Main Challenges of Machine Learning\n",
    "- In machine learning your main task is to select a learning algorithm and train it on some data, the two things that can go wrong are \"BAD ALGORITHM\" and \"BAD DATA\". \n",

    "## Let's start with examples of bad data :-\n",
    "### Insufficient Quantity of Training Data\n",
    "- For a child to learn what an apple is we have to do is to teach him by saying that this is an apple after repeting this procedure a few times a child is able to recognize apples in all sort of color and shapes Great\n",
    "- Machine Learning is not quite there yet, it takes a lot of data for most Machine Learning algorithms to work properly. Even for very simple problems you typically need thousands of examples, and for complex problems such as image or speech recognition you may need millions of examples\n",
    "![](insufficient_amount_of_data.jpg)\n",
    "### Non-representative Training Data\n",
    "- In order to get good results it is crucial that your training data must be representative of the cases you want to predict in future.\n",
    "- It is crucial to use a training set that is representative of these cases you want to generalize to. This is often harder then it sounds: if the sample is to small, you will have _sampling noise_, but even very large samples can be nonrepresentative if the sampling method is flawed This is called sampling bias\n",
    "### Poor - Quality Data\n",
    "- If our data is full of errors, mistakes, outliers and noise due to poor quality measurements, it will make it harder for the system to detect the pattern from the data so our model will not perform well often it is best to spend time cleaning up trainig data. The truth is that most Data Scientist or Machine Learning engineers spend there most time doing a data cleaning \n",
    "- If some instances are outliers in our dataset we can simply remove it or try to fix it manually\n",
    "- If some instances are missing a few features we can fill it aor we can remove it \n",
    "### Irrelevent Features\n",
    "- If the features are irrelevent not containing the proper information about the problem we are trying to solve then it will not perform well on real world\n",
    "- As the saying goes : Garbage in, Garbage out.\n",
    "- A critical part of the sucess of a Machine Learning project is coming up with a good set of features to train on this process is called featrure engineering it involes _Feature Selection: select most useful features, Feature Extraction:combining existing features to produce a more useful on, Creating a new feature by gathering a new data _\n",

In machine learning this is called overfitting\n",
